# Project_WISE
We created a python application - "Hostel HelpDesk", a complaint management system.

# Description
Generally, students in the hostels may face various issues related to their health or repairs in their hostel rooms. Typically, wardens visit each room to check whether any student is experiencing health issues, and students log repairs in their rooms into a physical logbook.

All of these tasks are currently performed manually. To reduce this burden on the wardens and eliminate the use of logbooks, we have developed a UI where all these tasks can be easily managed.
